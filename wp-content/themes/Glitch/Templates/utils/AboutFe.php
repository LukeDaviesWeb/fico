        <div class="copy-container">
            <p>I’ve had the opportunity to work with a wide scope of client bases from small boutique brands to those on a national scale including Dome, Kreepy Krawly and Cedar Woods. I have a particular passion for brand identities, packaging design and publication design</p>

            <p>I studied Graphic Design & Photography in Perth at Curtin University and completed my degree abroad in Germany. I graduated in the 2013 Masterclass which comprised of the top 5% of the graduating year. Following graduation I’ve had 3.5+ years experience working at creative agencies and 2 years experience working as an in-house designer at a national corporation.</p>

            <p>When not designing, I work on passion projects, take an annoying amount of photos with my 1980’s Canon and read books in the company of my overweight cat.</p>
